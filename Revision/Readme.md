# Mathematics for Machine Learning - Practice Problems

This repository contains essential mathematical problems for Machine Learning, covering Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, and Calculus. Below are the problems along with their solutions implemented in Python.

## 1. Linear Algebra: Matrix Operations

Given two matrices:

A = [[2, 3], [4, 5]]
B = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

Find:

A + B (Matrix Addition)

A - B (Matrix Subtraction)

A * B (Matrix Multiplication)

A⁻¹ (Inverse of A)

2. Probability: Conditional Probability

A bag contains 3 red balls and 5 blue balls. One ball is drawn at random, and then another ball is drawn without replacement. What is the probability that the second ball is red given that the first ball was red?

3. Statistics: Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation

Given the dataset:

X = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

Find:

The mean of X

The variance of X

The standard deviation of X

4. Calculus: Derivative and Gradient Calculation

Find the derivative of the function:

f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x + 2

at x = 2.
